# JavaScript Repo V1

A test repo for uploading JS code to git.

Ensure you use the git remote command before committing
as commiting without this will only be to local Git dir.

Syntax for this is below 
git remote add origin "SSH link from empty GitHub repository"

To see any remote repositories connected to this repo, below.
git remote -v 

# Testing changes in files when merging / doing pull requests
I am adding more lines into this file to check if the git diff command is working as it should be.
